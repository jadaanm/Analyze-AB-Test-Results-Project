# Analyze-AB-Test-Results-Project
## By Manal Al-Jadaan

## Project Overview
The project conducted A/B testing of user conversions from an old page to the new wepage. The steps include conducting probabilites Statistics, hypothesis test, bootstrapping, and Logistic regression.

## Project Goal 
The goal of of this project is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Statistical Analysis
-Bootstrapping sampling distributions 
-p-value calculations
-Z-core tests
-Logistic regression
-Multiple linear regression modelling

## Conclusion

Overall, based on the results of A/B test and fitting logistic model with different variabls, none of the p-values are statistically significant on the conversion rate, that is implementing a new page will not lead to higher rate of users conversions. Then, we fail to reject the null hypotheses which mean that the old page have same effectiveness or more than the new page
